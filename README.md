# LinkedListReversal in C++  
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.   

Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.   

LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.   

## Linked List Representation  
Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.   
0-->1-->2-->3-->4-->5-->6-->7-->8-->9-->10-->nullptr   

When reversed:  
10-->9-->8-->7-->6-->5-->4-->3-->2-->1-->0--->nullptr
